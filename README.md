# Safety-patrolling-and-detection-with-AMB82-Mini-
Safety patrolling and detection at construction sites is an application that require a microcontroller board with a camera and neural network capabilities. Hence, we will be using AMB82-Mini. This project can help improve safety, security, and monitoring at construction sites. Here's how you can implement it:
## Project Overview
Create a safety patrolling and detection system that uses a camera and neural network for real-time monitoring and detection of potential safety hazards and incidents at construction sites.
## Components Needed 
**AMB82-Mini board with camera**:  A High-resolution camera module that can capture clear images and video footage and neural network acceleration capabilities.  
**Sensors**: Consider adding additional sensors like motion sensors, temperature sensors, gas detectors, or environmental sensors to monitor conditions on-site.  
**Power Supply**: Ensure a stable power supply for continuous operation. Consider battery backup or solar power for remote locations.  
**Communication**: Implement a communication module (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular, or LoRa) to transmit data to a central monitoring station.  
**Enclosure**: Protect the electronics from dust, debris, and harsh environmental conditions with a weatherproof enclosure.  
## Functionality
**Object Detection**: Train neural network to recognize objects and conditions relevant to construction site safety. This may include detecting personnel, vehicles, equipment, safety gear, and potential hazards like fires or gas leaks.  
**Real-Time Monitoring**: The camera continuously captures images or video footage, which is processed in real-time by the neural network. Any detected anomalies or safety concerns trigger alerts.  
**Alerting System**: Implement an alerting system that can send notifications to site managers, supervisors, or security personnel when safety issues are detected. Alerts can be sent via SMS, email, or a dedicated monitoring dashboard.  
**Data Logging**: Log data from the camera and sensors for historical analysis and reporting. This can help identify patterns and trends in safety incidents.  
**Remote Access**: Provide remote access to the monitoring system so that authorized personnel can view live video feeds and sensor data from anywhere, improving responsiveness.  
**Environmental Monitoring**: Use environmental sensors to monitor factors like temperature, humidity, and air quality, as these can also impact safety on construction sites.  

## Deployment 
- It can be installed at strategic locations around the construction site, ensuring that critical areas are covered.
- Configure the neural network to adapt to different lighting conditions and potential changes in the site environment.

## Benefits of this application
- Improved safety for workers and equipment.
- Early detection of potential hazards or security breaches.
- Reduced response times to incidents.
- Enhanced site security through continuous monitoring.
- Historical data for analysis and compliance reporting.
